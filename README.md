_**#0: Unity Bone Pixel Animation Prototype**_
----------------------------------------------

Although I use Unity’s bone system in raster graphics, I never tried that in the pixel characters. Thanks to Nat, I read this [post](http://de.esotericsoftware.com/forum/Using-Spine-with-Pixelart-in-Dan-The-Man-7532) and start to prototype it.

In this prototype, the character [Woodcutter](https://opengameart.org/content/3-character-sprite-sheets) is used. ![Woodcutter](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/woodcutter/Woodcutter.png)

_(This character will not be used in our game, it is for testing purposes only)_

**Step 1:**

Image scaled up and layers seperated/repainted missing parts in the Photoshop.

**Photoshop Layers:**

![photoshop-layers](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/woodcutter/photoshop-layers.jpg)

Saved as PSB file and imported into Unity.

**Unity Packages:**

--------------------------------------------------

This is my 2D pixel character animations for the protagonist. We can also use this same bone animations for the other characters as well.

Both FK and IK bones are used.

_**#2: Character Animations – Other Characters**_
=================================================

  

**The Strive** has 16 characters in the game at the moment I worked on the other characters to implement bones.

**Characters:** 32px

![16Characters](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/animation-v1/16Characters.png)

All of them scaled up to 256px.

**Photoshop:**

![Photoshop-Preview](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/animation-v1/Photoshop-Preview.jpg)

**Layers:**

![Photoshop-Layers](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/animation-v1/Photoshop-Layers.png)

All characters separated into each **PSB file**.

![PSB-Files-Preview](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/animation-v1/PSB-Files-Preview.jpg)

Missing parts were painted, layers were named and lined up in Photoshop.

**Bones:**

![Bones](https://gokdenizcetin.com/assets/img/portfolio/games/thestrive/animation-v1/Bones.jpg)
